# Estimating local SNP-heritability

This page describes the steps to estimate local SNP-heritability from GWAS
summary association data. In the first step, HESS computes the eigenvalues of
LD matrices, and the squared projections of GWAS effect size vector onto the
eigenvectors of LD matrices. In the second step, HESS uses the output from
step 1 to obtain estimates of local SNP-heritability and their standard errors.

## Step 1 - compute eigenvalues and squared projections

### Running the tool

In this step, HESS computes the eigenvalues, and the squared projections of
GWAS effect size vector onto the eigenvectors of LD matrices. The following
code provides an example of how to perform this tep.

```
for chrom in $(seq 22)
do
    python hess.py \
        --local-hsqg <summary statistics> \
        --chrom $chrom \
        --bfile <reference panel in PLINK format for the specific chromosome> \
        --partition <genome partition file for the specific chromosome> \
        --out step1
done
```

In the command above, `--local-hsqg` tells HESS to estimate local
SNP-heritability, and is used to specify the GWAS summary statistics data;
`--chrom` is used to specify the chromosome number; `--bfile` is used to
specify the reference panel for the corresponding chromsome; `--partition` is
used to specify the genome partition file; `--out` is used to specify the
prefix of the output file. For input file format, please refer to
[Input Format](https://huwenboshi.github.io/hess-0.5/input_format/).

( <b>Note</b>: The above for loop can be parallelized by chromosome in case a
computer cluster is available. In addition, users can specify the minimum
minor allele frequency (MAF) of the SNPs used for estimation through the
"--min-maf" flag. The default MAF threshold is 0.05. )
</div>

### Interpreting the output

After executing the command above, 4 files will be created for each
chromosome (i.e. 88 files for all 22 chromosomes in total), taking up ~10MB
of space for the entire genome. The following is an example output obtained
for chromosome 22.

* **step1_chr22.info.gz** - contains the locus information, including start and end
positions, number of SNPs, rank of LD matrices, and sample size

## Step 2 - estimate local SNP-heritability and standard error

### Running the tool (without using total SNP-heritability)

In the second step, HESS uses output from step 1 across all chromosomes
(step1_chr{1..22}.info.gz, step1_chr{1..22}.eig.gz, step1_chr{1..22}.prjsq.gz)
to obtain local SNP-heritability estimates and their standard errors. The
following command automatically looks for output from step 1 across all
chromosomes with the prefix "step1" to obtain local SNP-heritability estimates.

```
python hess.py --prefix step1 --out step2
```

<div style="background-color:rgba(240, 128, 128, 0.2);">
( <b>Note</b>: This is the recommended way of running HESS. However, if sample
size of the GWAS is relatively small and total SNP-heritability is known, e.g.
estimated from individual-level data, then one may use the script in the
next section to obtain local SNP-heritability estimates. Also note that no
for loop is needed here. )
</div>

### Note on re-inflating \\(\lambda_{GC}\\)

Most GWAS summary stats are corrected for genomic control factor
\\(\lambda_{GC}\\). This could result in a downward bias in the estimated
SNP-heritability. If the GWAS summary stats has been corrected for
\\(\lambda_{GC}\\), it is recommended to use the following code to perform
step 2.

```
python hess.py --prefix step1 --reinflate-lambda-gc <lambda gc to reinflate> \
               --out step2
```

### Running the tool (using total SNP-heritability)

If sample size of the GWAS is relatively small, the standard error of total
SNP-heritability estimates of HESS can be large, which could then lead to
large standard error in the local estimates. However, if an estimate of total
SNP-heritability is available, then one may use the following script to
decompose the total SNP-heritability into each locus.

```
python hess.py --prefix step1 --tot-hsqg <total SNP-heritability> <SE> --out step2
```

It is recommended to use the following code if the GWAS summary stats are
corrected for \\(\lambda_{GC}\\).

```
python hess.py --prefix step1 --reinflate-lambda-gc <lambda gc to reinflate> \
               --tot-hsqg <total SNP-heritability> <SE> --out step2
```


#### Other available flags

* `--max-num-eig`: Specifies the number of eigenvectors to use in the
truncated-SVD for inverting the LD matrix, default 50
* `--min-eigval`: Specifies the minimum eigenvalue cut off in
truncated-SVD, default 1.0
* `--reinflate-lambda-gc`: Specifies the genomic control factor that has been
applied to the summary statistics, default 1.0
* `--gwse-thres`: A threshold to cap the standard error of total
SNP-heritability estimate

<div style="background-color:rgba(230, 230, 250, 1.0);">
( <b>Note</b>: We recommend to run HESS on GWAS summary statistics that has
not been applied the genomic control factor, which could results in downward
bias. )
</div>

We provide a simple script (`misc/estimate_lambdagc.py`) to infer the genomic
control factor to reinflate the summary statistics if it is unknown. The
following script should be executed after step 1 completes.
```
python misc/estimate_lambdagc.py --prefix step1
```

### Interpreting the output

After step 2, 2 files will be created. These include

* **step2.txt**: contains local SNP-heritability estimates for all loci across all
chromosomes. The columns are chromosome number, locus start position, locus
end position, number of SNPs in locus, number of eigenvectors used
in truncated-SVD, estimates of local SNP-heritability, estimated variance
of the local SNP-heritability. We also report standard error and test
statistics.
